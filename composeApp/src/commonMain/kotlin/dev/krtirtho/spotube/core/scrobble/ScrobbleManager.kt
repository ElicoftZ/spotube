/**
 * Watches local playback and submits scrobbles through the currently selected scrobble plugin.
 *
 * Scrobbling follows the standard Last.fm rules, which plugins are expected to honour as well:
 * - Tracks shorter than [MIN_TRACK_DURATION_MS] are never scrobbled.
 * - The track must be listened to for at least half of its duration, or [MAX_SCROBBLE_THRESHOLD_MS],
 *   whichever comes first.
 *
 * Only time during which the player is actively [PlayerState.PLAYING] is counted, so pauses are
 * ignored, and forward seeks don't credit unheard audio. The timestamp sent with the scrobble is
 * the moment playback of the track started. Each play is scrobbled at most once; replaying or
 * repeating the track starts a new scrobble session.
